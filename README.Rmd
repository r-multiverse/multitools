[R-multiverse](https://r-multiverse.org) is a community-curated, maintainer-driven repository of R package releases based on [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev). The `multitools` package has tools for maintainers of packages in [R-multiverse](https://github.com/r-multiverse/help).

# Documentation

Please see <https://r-multiverse.org/multitools> for documentation, including a function reference.

# Code of Conduct

Please note that the `multitools` project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://r-multiverse.org/conduct.html). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

# Help

Please post bug reports to <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help/issues> and general questions to <https://github.com/r-multiverse/help/discussions>.

# Installation

For the development version:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("r-multiverse/multitools")
```

For the latest release:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
  "multitools",
  repos = c("https://r-multiverse.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos"))
)
```

# Version etiquette

It is good practice to increment the version number of a package on every new release. The `check_versions()` list the packages that have chosen to decrement the version number or keep it the same over the course of the release cycle. For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
check_versions()
#> # A tibble: 2 × 5
#>   package version_current version_highest hash_current                  hash_highest
#>   <chr>   <chr>           <chr>           <chr>                         <chr>       
#> 1 pkg.a   1.0.0           2.0.0           1f9928593251410322823fefea8c… 8e7f9fe32c4…
#> 2 pkg.b   3.0.0           3.0.0           7f608bde8f0e308aa8866d737dde… e59165f73b7…
```

Package `pkg.a` was flagged because the current version is lower than the highest version ever released. Package `pkg.b` was flagged because there are two different releases under version 3.0.0.

To fix the version number of an R-multiverse package that you maintain, create a new GitHub/GitLab release whose version number in the `DESCRIPTION` file is higher than the one in the `version_highest` column in the output of `check_versions()`.
